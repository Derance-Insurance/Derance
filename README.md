# Derance Insurance 
Derance Insurance provides smart contract insurance across cross-chains with optimised pricing models and launches insurance investment functions with mining, staking with NFT programmes, and deflationary token economics to provide participants with long-term returns. The claims management is carried out through voting mechanisms set in place.


## Solutions Overview 
- Multi-step voting to be adopted for claims inspection; rewards will be given out to voters. 
- Notify users about major events such as voting and governance by reporting in multiple announcement channels. 

## Token Economics 
- Issuance of DRC token which acts as governance and utility token.
- DRC tokens can be used in community incentives, voting representation, converting staking into NFTs, and mining and staking rewards for capital provision to the insurance liquidity pool.

## Features and Designs 
- DRC tokens can be purchased with Binance tokens such as BNB and BUSD.
- Users lock and stake DRC to provide insurance coverage for smart contracts, stakers split profit and yield equally. 
- Liquidity will  be provided to secondary markets. Yields are used to invest across lending platforms, such as Pancake Swap, Venus, and Bearn.
- Cover will be provided to smart contracts that claim to have been exploited (See sub-heading “Claim Cover”).
- Interests made in DRC are unlocked and can be claimed immediately.
- A claim assessor has to stake some DRC before a claim can be made. If it is a false claim, the token will be burnt. While if a claim gets approved, the smart contract keeps the tokens, and receives compensation from the unlocked tokens in DRC.
- Votes are proportional to the Rance tokens at a ratio 1:1. One vote is given by one DRC token.

### Claim Cover 
Compensation will be given under the following conditions:
- The given smart contract address, suffers a hack during the cover period that is a direct outcome of its smart contract code being used in an inadvertent way; which eventually gives rise to loss of funds from the smart contract, where the funds are either transferred to another address not controlled by the original owner or owners, or made impossible to recoup.
- Cryptographic evidence is made available, which links the victimized account to the covered smart contract that is submitting the claim.
- The covered smart contract submits a claim during the cover period or within 35 days of the cover closing. Once the claim has been approved, the cover has expired. So another cover has to be purchased if there are remaining days for coverage.

### Claims Assessment 
- When claims are made, the multi-step voting process commences. Voters whose votes end up being in the majority get rewards, while addresses of voters in the minority do not get rewards.

### Token Flow 
- When users buy insurance, the premium is distributed: 70% is burned; 20% is given to stakers; 10% is locked to pay voters in the event of a claim.

## Token Economics Summary
At launch, tokens distributed to founders, contributors and early members will be distributed as follows:
- Liquidity 40%
- Vault 6%
- Team 19%
- Community 4%
- Emergency 6%
- Sale 9%
